# ML Algorithms from Scratch

This repository consists of key Machine Learning algorithms and concepts created and executed by me from scratch. I believe that the best way of learning something new is by working at the lowest level of abstraction feasible and this project is an exercise of this thought.

### Algorithms implemented:

1) Linear Regression (Batch, Mini-Batch, Stochastic, with Momentum) 
2) Regularised Regression
3) Binary Classification
4) Multiclass Classification
5) Base Nearest Neighbours
6) K-Nearest Neighbours
7) K-Means Clustering
